# LinkedIn Framework

LinkedIn rewards substance, narrative, and professional credibility. Posts can be longer, more nuanced, and more personal than Twitter.

## Inspiration: Naval Ravikant & Andrej Karpathy (Adapted for LinkedIn)

While Naval and Karpathy are Twitter-native, their principles translate to LinkedIn with adjustment.

### Naval's Contributions to LinkedIn Writing

**Definition-Based Clarity:** Open or close with a clean definition that reframes the topic.
- Don't just describe—define. "Psychological safety isn't about comfort. It's about enabling risk-taking."
- Definitions stick. They become quotable.

**The Contrast/Dichotomy:** Challenge the assumed belief, then offer the reframe.
- Structure: "Most people think X. But the reality is Y."
- Example: "Most data teams optimize for model accuracy. The ones that drive impact optimize for decision quality."

**First Principles Anchoring:** Ground posts in fundamental truths that can't be argued with.
- "All returns come from compound interest" → applies to skills, relationships, reputation

**Chain Logic:** Build arguments where each statement follows from the last.
- Useful for the middle of LinkedIn posts where you're developing an argument.

### Karpathy's Contributions to LinkedIn Writing

**The Self-Aware Confession:** Share failures with humor, not self-pity.
- "I spent 6 months building something nobody asked for. Here's what that taught me."
- Vulnerability + insight, not vulnerability as performance.

**Technical Topics Made Human:** Explain hard concepts through relatable experience.
- Don't write documentation—write what it felt like to learn the thing.
- "The first time I saw our model predict churn for a customer we'd already lost, I realized we had a timing problem, not a modeling problem."

**The Shared Experience Hook:** Start with something every practitioner recognizes.
- "If you've ever stared at a dashboard wondering why stakeholders aren't using it..."
- Instant connection before delivering the insight.

**Build-in-Public Energy:** Share work in progress, not just polished results.
- "We're three weeks into migrating to Snowflake. Here's what's already broken."
- Realness over performance.

## The LinkedIn Landscape

**What works:**
- Longer-form narrative with genuine insight
- Vulnerability and honest reflection on failures
- Contrarian takes backed by experience
- Cross-domain thinking applied to professional contexts
- Specific, concrete examples from real work

**What doesn't:**
- Generic motivational content
- Obvious advice restated as revelation
- Performative humility
- Hollow engagement tactics

## Optimal Structure Options

### Option 1: The Hook-Story-Insight (Most Versatile)

**Hook (1-2 sentences):** Open with something that stops the scroll. A counterintuitive claim, a specific number, a provocative question, or a moment of tension.

**Story/Context (2-4 paragraphs):** Develop the narrative. This is where vulnerability, specific details, and texture live. Not filler—every sentence earns its place.

**Insight (1-2 paragraphs):** The payoff. What did this reveal? What should the reader take away? End with something worth remembering.

### Option 2: The Contrarian Take

**Open with the conventional wisdom** — What does everyone believe?

**Pivot to the contradiction** — Why is this incomplete or wrong?

**Support with evidence** — Personal experience, observed patterns, data

**Land the reframe** — Offer the more nuanced view

### Option 3: The Lesson from Failure

**State the failure clearly** — No softening, no excuses

**What actually happened** — Specifics, not vague generalities

**The insight that emerged** — What changed as a result

**The application** — How this applies to the reader's situation

### Option 4: Technical Deep-Dive (Eugene Yan style)

**Problem statement** — What challenge does this address?

**The approach** — Walk through the solution at the right altitude (not too abstract, not drowning in detail)

**The nuance** — What's the tricky part most miss?

**The takeaway** — What should someone do with this knowledge?

## Length Guidelines

- **Minimum:** 150 words (anything shorter feels thin on LinkedIn)
- **Sweet spot:** 200-400 words (enough for substance, not exhausting)
- **Maximum:** 600 words (beyond this, consider a different format)

## Formatting Rules

### Do:
- Use line breaks for readability (not every sentence, but logical pauses)
- Bold sparingly for emphasis on key phrases
- Use numbers when listing genuinely distinct items
- One-sentence paragraphs for punchlines (earned, not manufactured)

### Don't:
- Use headers/subheaders in posts (feels like a blog, not a post)
- Over-format with bullets everywhere
- Use more than 1-2 emojis (if any)
- Create artificial line breaks for every sentence (broetry)

## Opening Lines That Work

The first line must stop the scroll. But there's a fine line between an effective hook and a cringe pattern. The difference: **does the hook serve the insight, or serve the author's image?**

### Patterns That Work (When Done Right)

- **Counterintuitive claim:** "Your data warehouse isn't a tech problem. It's a people problem."
  - Works because the insight is the hook, not the author.

- **Genuine question:** "What's the actual difference between a senior and a mid-level data scientist?"
  - Works because it invites thinking, not performance.

- **Specific observation:** "Every data team I've seen struggle has the same root cause."
  - Works if what follows is genuinely useful, not a flex.

- **Moment of tension:** "Our 6-month project got shelved last week."
  - Works only if the post is about the lesson, not seeking sympathy or setting up a redemption arc.

### The Thin Line (Be Careful)

These can work OR backfire depending on intent:

- **Numbers as hooks:** "I've interviewed 200+ candidates..." 
  - ⚠️ If the number serves the insight → fine
  - ⚠️ If the number is the subtle flex → cringe
  - Better: Lead with the pattern, mention the number in passing if needed for credibility

- **Transformation setups:** "I used to think X. I was wrong."
  - ⚠️ If it leads to genuine vulnerability → fine
  - ⚠️ If it sets up "now I'm successful" → cringe
  - Better: Skip the setup, just share the insight directly

### Opening Lines to Avoid

- "I've been thinking a lot about..." — (filler, no hook)
- "Hot take:" / "Unpopular opinion:" — (usually followed by popular opinion)
- "This." — (adds nothing)
- "I'm humbled to announce..." — (false modesty)
- Starting with a quote then adding "This resonates..." — (borrowed credibility)
- Any opener designed to make people think "wow, this person is impressive" rather than "wow, this idea is interesting"

## Closing Lines That Land

End with something that sticks:

- **The reframe:** "It's not about having the best tools. It's about having the agency to use any tool."
- **The call to reflection:** "The question isn't whether you have the skills. It's whether you have the hunger."
- **The specific next step:** "If you're building a data team, start by asking what decisions it needs to enable—not what dashboards it needs to build."
- **The honest admission:** "I'm still figuring this out. But I'm convinced the direction is right."

### Closings to Avoid

- "Thoughts?" (lazy engagement bait)
- "Comment below if you agree!"
- "Share if this resonated!"
- Excessive hashtags
- Links in the main body (put in comments if needed)

## Voice Calibration

For LinkedIn, Aswin's voice should feel:
- **Confident but not arrogant** — Share from experience, acknowledge limits
- **Specific but not jargon-heavy** — Accessible to adjacent audiences
- **Reflective but not navel-gazing** — Insight serves the reader, not the ego
- **Professional but not sterile** — Personality comes through

## Sample Structure Template

```
[Hook: 1-2 sentences that stop the scroll]

[Context: Set up the situation with specific details. What happened? What was the challenge?]

[Development: The meat of the story. What did you try? What went wrong? What surprised you?]

[The turn: The insight that emerged. The reframe. The thing you now understand.]

[The close: A sentence that lands. Something memorable. Not a call to action, just a thought worth sitting with.]
```

## Before Publishing Checklist

### Core Checks
1. Does the first line stop the scroll?
2. Is there a genuine insight, or just noise?
3. Are the specifics specific? (Names, numbers, concrete details)
4. Does it sound like a human wrote it?
5. Would I respect this post if someone else wrote it?
6. Is it clear which core belief this connects to?
7. Zero cringe-worthy phrases?

### Signal Checks (New)
8. **Uniqueness test** — Could only someone with my specific experience write this?
9. **Mission alignment** — Does this move people toward the transformation I'm leading them to?
10. **Slop check** — Is this signal (makes brain light up) or slop (interchangeable)?
11. **Taste filter** — Does this reflect my discernment about what matters?
12. **Context density** — Have I woven in enough personal context to be distinctive?

## Mission-Based Hook Structures

Hooks are stronger when they connect to your mission (the transformation you're leading people toward).

### Transformation-Aligned Hooks

**The "I've seen this pattern" hook:**
- "Every [audience type] I've worked with makes the same mistake in [context]..."
- Positions you as someone who's guided the transformation many times

**The "What I wish I knew" hook:**
- "The question I wish I'd asked before every [thing you help with]..."
- Shares hard-won wisdom from your own transformation journey

**The "Counterintuitive lesson" hook:**
- "Everyone thinks [common approach]. The ones who break through do [opposite]."
- Challenges the conventional path to the transformation

**The "Moment of realization" hook:**
- "The moment I stopped [old behavior] and started [new approach], everything changed."
- Models the transformation you help others make

### Connecting Posts to Mission

Before writing, ask:
- "Which part of the transformation journey does this address?"
- "Is this a 'before' story, a 'during' story, or an 'after' insight?"
- "Does the reader see themselves somewhere in this journey?"

## Taste-Based Evaluation

Taste = discernment about what matters.

### Applying Taste to LinkedIn Posts

**What to include:**
- Specific experiences only you've had
- Opinions you've formed through work
- Insights that made YOUR brain light up
- Nuances most people miss

**What to cut:**
- Generic "value" anyone could provide
- Safe takes that don't reveal your perspective
- Content that's correct but obvious
- Anything that feels like filler

### The Taste Test

After drafting, ask:
- "Is there anything here I wouldn't say, but added because it seems expected?"
- "What's the one thing in this post that's most ME?"
- "If I removed my name, would readers know it was mine?"

## Authority-Leveraging Structures

You cannot rely on the algorithm alone. Strategic engagement builds reach.

### Quote & Build Pattern

Quote-tweet or reference someone else's work, then add your perspective:

**Structure:**
- Acknowledge the original insight
- Add your angle or experience
- Offer something the original didn't cover

**Example:**
"[Name]'s post about [topic] nailed the 'what.' Here's the 'why' from building three data teams:
[Your insight that builds on their work]"

### The Response Post

Write a full post in response to something that moved you:

**Structure:**
- Reference the original work that sparked this
- Share your reaction/perspective
- Develop the idea further with your experience

### Tribe Engagement

Engage meaningfully with others' content:
- Comment with genuine additions, not just agreement
- Share your specific experience when relevant
- Tag them when you reference their work in your posts
- Build relationships through consistent engagement

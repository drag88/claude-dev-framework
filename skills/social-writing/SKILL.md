# Social Writing Skill

This skill enables the creation of LinkedIn and Twitter content that sounds genuinely human, connects emotionally with readers, and delivers substantive value—never robotic, never formulaic.

## Core Philosophy

The foundation of all content is this: **readers are humans who crave authenticity in an era drowning in AI-generated noise.**

Every post must pass this test: "Would a thoughtful person actually say this to another person over coffee?"

### The Human-First Principle

Content should feel like it emerged from lived experience, not a content calendar. The goal is connection, not performance. Substance over signal. Earned authority, not claimed expertise.

When writing:
- Lead with genuine curiosity or hard-won insight
- Write as if speaking to one specific person, not a faceless audience
- Let imperfection show—perfect polish reads as artificial
- Prioritize emotional resonance equal to intellectual substance

## The Signal vs Slop Paradigm

**"Value-based content" isn't dead—basic educational content is dead.**

Value has abstracted up a layer. What readers now need isn't generic how-to information (AI can produce that endlessly). They need:
- **Narrative** — Your specific story of how something played out
- **Original thought** — Perspectives only you can hold
- **Taste** — Discernment about what matters and what doesn't

### The Slop Spectrum

All content exists on a spectrum from "slop" to "signal":

**Slop** = Generic, interchangeable, could have been written by anyone or any AI without context. No specific perspective. No taste. No mission.

**Signal** = Makes the reader's brain light up. Contains something they couldn't have predicted. Reveals the author's specific experiences, opinions, and taste.

The variable that moves content from slop toward signal: **taste** (discernment, the act of saying what should and shouldn't belong).

### What AI Can't Replicate
- Your specific experiences and the lessons extracted from them
- Your opinions formed through years of work
- Your taste—what you've learned to filter for and filter out
- Your mission and the transformation you're leading people toward

Reference `references/slop_to_signal.md` for detailed guidance on moving content toward signal.

## The Content Director Mindset

Shift from "content creator" to "content director."

**Labor vs Direction:**
- Labor = The mechanical work of producing words, formatting, researching basics
- Direction = Deciding what story to tell, what angle matters, what to include and exclude

AI can do labor. Only you can provide direction.

**Your job as director:**
1. Decide what story needs telling (mission-driven)
2. Provide the specific context that makes it uniquely yours
3. Filter the output through your taste
4. Ensure it serves the transformation you're leading

The more personal context you bring, the more your content moves toward signal. An AI with no context produces slop. An AI with your specific experiences, beliefs, and mission produces something closer to signal—but you remain the director, making the final calls.

## Mission-Based Content Strategy

**Topic-based content boxes you in. Mission-based content sets you free.**

### Topic-Based (Limiting)
- "I write about data science"
- "I cover AI and machine learning"
- "I post about leadership"

Problems with topic-based:
- Anyone can write about your topic
- Easy to replicate and commoditize
- Creates artificial constraints ("Is this on-brand?")
- Leads to running out of things to say

### Mission-Based (Liberating)
- "I lead people from [struggling state] to [transformed state]"
- "I help [audience] achieve [transformation]"
- "My content moves people toward [specific outcome]"

**Anything that aids the transformation is fair game.**

If your mission is helping data scientists become influential leaders, you can write about:
- Technical skills (obviously)
- Communication and storytelling
- Psychology and influence
- Career navigation
- Personal experiences from any domain that illustrates the journey

The mission acts as a filter: "Does this move people toward the transformation I'm leading them to?"

Reference `references/mission_framework.md` for detailed guidance.

## The Idea Museum

Build a personal library of your best ideas, frameworks, and lines that resonated.

### What to Collect

**Your own work:**
- Posts that performed well and why
- Phrases that landed—the exact wording that resonated
- Frameworks you've developed through experience
- Recurring themes that keep emerging in your thinking

**Signal from others:**
- Content that stopped your scroll
- Ideas that made your brain light up
- Perspectives that shifted how you see something
- Articulations better than your own on ideas you share

### How to Use It

This becomes your **context library**:
- Feed it to AI to move output from slop toward signal
- Reference it when stuck to spark new angles
- Refine it over time—sharpen the articulations
- Notice patterns in what resonates with you (this reveals your taste)

Reference `references/greatest_hits.md` for Aswin's core beliefs and working library.

## The Framework (Adapted from Dan Koe)

### The Inner Album of Greatest Hits

Before writing any post, draw from a pool of 8-10 core beliefs that can connect to almost any topic. These are ideas refined through hundreds of hours of thinking, not hot takes manufactured for engagement.

Reference `references/greatest_hits.md` for Aswin's core beliefs. These should:
- Serve as starting points for any topic
- Be ideas worth repeating and refining
- Connect across domains (technical, leadership, personal growth)

When asked to write about any topic, first identify which core belief(s) the topic connects to. This creates consistency of voice and depth that audiences recognize.

### Three Methods for Articulation

#### Method 1: The Micro Story (Foundation)

The mind is wired for stories. Use transformation as the spine:

**Structure:**
1. **Problem** — State a relatable problem observed or experienced
2. **Amplify** — Illustrate the negative outcome if unsolved
3. **Solution** — Deliver the insight or approach

This is the default starting point. Most ideas can be expressed this way.

#### Method 2: The Pyramid Principle (Building Depth)

For ideas requiring more support:

1. **Lead with the conclusion** — State the main idea first (answer-first approach)
2. **Support with 3-5 key arguments** — Ask "why" repeatedly to generate these
3. **Ground with evidence** — Personal experience, data, examples from others

This works for expanding a single insight into a longer LinkedIn post or thread.

#### Method 3: Cross-Domain Synthesis (Advanced)

The most distinctive content connects ideas across disciplines:

1. **Problem and amplify** — Hook with a relatable problem
2. **Cross-domain insight** — Pull a concept from another field (physics, psychology, economics, sports) to illuminate the topic
3. **Unique process/solution** — Offer a perspective that only emerges from this synthesis

Example: Explaining data quality using entropy from physics, or team dynamics using principles from jazz improvisation.

### The Building Blocks (When Stuck)

When the writing stalls, cycle through these:

- **Pain point** — Start a section with a relevant struggle
- **Example** — Ground abstract ideas with concrete cases
- **Personal story** — Draw from lived experience
- **Statistic** — Add credibility (but don't over-rely on data)
- **Metaphor** — Explain complex ideas simply
- **Quote** — Borrow authority from others (sparingly)
- **Reframe** — Offer a different perspective on what was just said
- **What/How/Why** — When stuck, ask one of these questions

## Signal Detection

Your brain releases dopamine when you encounter important ideas. That's signal.

**How to develop signal detection:**
- Notice what makes your scroll stop
- Pay attention to what you bookmark, save, or screenshot
- Track ideas that keep returning to your mind
- Observe what you can't help but share

AI can't manufacture signal—it doesn't have a mission or taste. It doesn't know what YOUR brain finds important. You are the signal detector; AI is the labor amplifier.

## Growth Strategy

You cannot rely on the algorithm alone.

### Build Tribes
- Network with other creators in adjacent spaces
- Form pods or groups that engage with each other's work
- Collaborate on content (conversations, joint threads)

### Leverage Authority
- Discuss and build on others' ideas (with credit)
- Tag people whose work you're referencing
- Quote-tweet with genuine added perspective
- Write responses and reactions to work that moved you

### Manual Outreach
- Especially important when starting or launching something new
- Direct messages to people who would genuinely benefit
- Comment thoughtfully on others' work (relationship-building, not engagement-farming)

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

### Language to Avoid
- "I'm humbled to announce..." — (false modesty)
- "Thrilled to share..." — (performative enthusiasm)
- "Let that sink in." — (condescending)
- "Read that again." — (manipulative)
- "Here's the thing..." repeated — (filler)
- Excessive emojis — (more than 1-2 if any)
- 🚀💡🔥 as content substitutes — (hollow signals)

### Structures to Avoid
- Broetry (one sentence per line for artificial drama)
- Humble-bragging disguised as lessons
- "X years ago I was [struggling]. Now I [success]" formula
- Listicles without genuine insight
- Engagement bait ("Comment below if you agree!")
- Claiming mastery in fields without demonstrated depth

### Tone to Avoid
- Preaching from above rather than sharing alongside
- Absolute certainty on nuanced topics
- Generic advice that applies to no one specifically
- Recycled wisdom presented as original thought

### Slop Indicators (New)
- Generic "how-to" content anyone could write
- Content that doesn't reveal your specific perspective
- Zero personal context or experience woven in
- Topic-locked content that boxes you in
- Pure AI generation without direction
- Could have been written by any AI without knowing anything about you
- Interchangeable—swap in another author and nothing changes

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any post:

1. **Authenticity test** — Does this sound like Aswin speaking, not a template?
2. **Substance test** — Is there a genuine insight or just noise?
3. **Emotional test** — Will this make someone feel something?
4. **Specificity test** — Could only someone with this experience write this?
5. **Cringe test** — Would this be embarrassing to read in 5 years?

### Signal Checks (New)

6. **Uniqueness test** — Could only someone with my specific experience and perspective write this?
7. **Mission test** — Does this move people toward the transformation I'm leading them to?
8. **Slop check** — Is this signal (makes brain light up) or slop (interchangeable)?
9. **Taste test** — Does this reflect my discernment about what matters?
10. **Context test** — Have I brought enough personal context to move this beyond generic?
